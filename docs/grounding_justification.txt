GROUNDING JUSTIFICATION: Why RAG is Essential for HR Onboarding Agent

1. COMPANY-SPECIFIC POLICIES (Not in Pre-training)
   - LLMs don't know YOUR company's remote work policy
   - Equipment specifications change (M1 vs M2 MacBooks)
   - PTO policies vary by organization
   - Without RAG: Agent would hallucinate generic policies

2. COMPLIANCE & LEGAL ACCURACY
   - Training requirements are legally mandated
   - Incorrect information = compliance violations = fines
   - Must cite exact policy version and section
   - Without RAG: Risk of outdated or incorrect compliance info

3. DYNAMIC CHECKLISTS
   - Onboarding tasks differ by role (Engineer vs Sales)
   - New departments added → new checklists created
   - Pre-trained model frozen at training cutoff
   - Without RAG: Agent wouldn't know role-specific requirements

4. AUDITABILITY & TRUST
   - HR needs to verify: "Where did this recommendation come from?"
   - RAG provides source citations: "According to employee_handbook.pdf, Section 3..."
   - Without RAG: Black box decisions, no traceability

5. REAL-TIME UPDATES
   - Policy updated today? RAG reflects it immediately
   - No need to retrain model (costly, slow)
   - Just re-ingest updated PDFs
   - Without RAG: Stale information for months

6. COST EFFICIENCY
   - Fine-tuning LLM for each company = $$$
   - RAG works with base model + company docs
   - Shareable architecture across clients
   - Without RAG: Custom model per organization = not scalable

EXAMPLE FAILURE WITHOUT RAG:
User: "What laptop do engineers get?"
LLM (no RAG): "Typically a laptop, contact IT for details" ❌
LLM (with RAG): "Engineers receive MacBook Pro M2 16GB according to Equipment Policy, Section 2. IT will order within 24 hours." ✅

METADATA FILTERING IMPORTANCE:
Query: "What's the remote work policy?"
Without filters: Returns 47 chunks (policies, checklists, employee records)
With filters {doc_type: "policy", department: "HR"}: Returns 3 relevant chunks
Result: Faster, more accurate responses
